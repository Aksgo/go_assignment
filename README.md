GO lang Assignment for Multiverse of Languages: Intro to Go lang Workshop.

As a part of this assignment, you would have to complete some simple Golang functions present in the `tasks` directory!

To run the project:

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) on your system.
3. Solve the tasks!
5. Check your score by running the command ```go test ./...```
4. When done, push the same to GitHub and create a Pull Request to submit your work.

## How to implement tasks

There are 5 files in tasks package that consist of incomplete code blocks, which you have to complete. Necessary hints and examples are given in the comments associated with a task.

- Implement the function using your GO lang knowledge and verify your solution by running tests until the failed test passes.
- Even after your solution passes, try to refactor it! Try to make your code as pretty and simple as possible keeping the tests successful!
- You can see your total score in the tests in the command line where you ran the ```go test ./...``` command. You can include a screenshot of the same while submitting the pull request.
